# Virat-Kohli-Marks-SQL-Project-

### **Project Overview**  
This project delves into **Virat Kohli's Class 10 exam marks**, analyzing them through SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. The dataset includes subject-wise marks, ranking, grade categorization, percentage calculation, and various queries to evaluate his academic performance. The entire project is well-documented in a **PowerPoint presentation (Virat Kohli SQL Project.pdf)** and the corresponding SQL script **(ViratKohli10thMarksAnalysis.sql)**.

---

### **Dataset Summary**  
The dataset is constructed using **Virat Kohli's official CBSE Class 10 mark sheet** from 2004. The subjects and marks recorded are:

| Subject             | Marks |
|--------------------|------|
| English           | 83   |
| Hindi            | 75   |
| Mathematics       | 51   |
| Science & Tech    | 55   |
| Social Science    | 81   |
| Introductory IT   | 74   |

These marks serve as the basis for various SQL queries and analyses.

### **SQL Table Creation and Data Insertion**  
#### **Creating the SQL Table:**  

```sql
-- Create the table to store Virat Kohli's Class 10 marks
CREATE TABLE Kohli_Marks (
    Student_Name VARCHAR(50),
    Subject VARCHAR(50),
    Marks INT
);
```

#### **Inserting Data into the Table:**  

```sql
-- Insert Virat Kohli's marks into the table
INSERT INTO Kohli_Marks (Student_Name, Subject, Marks) VALUES 
('Virat Kohli', 'English', 83),
('Virat Kohli', 'Hindi', 75),
('Virat Kohli', 'Mathematics', 51),
('Virat Kohli', 'Science', 55),
('Virat Kohli', 'Social Science', 81),
('Virat Kohli', 'Introductory IT', 74);
```

This setup enables analysis using SQL queries.
